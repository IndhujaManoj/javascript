      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has resulted in an unprecedented crisis across the globe. The pandemic created an enormous demand for innovative technologies to solve crisis-specific problems in different sectors of society. In the case of the education sector and allied learning technologies, significant issues have emerged while substituting face-to-face learning with online virtual learning. Several countries have closed educational institutions temporarily to alleviate the COVID-19 spread. The closure of educational institutions compelled the teachers across the globe to use online meeting platforms extensively. The virtual classrooms created by online meeting platforms are adopted as the only alternative for face â€“ to - face interaction in physical classrooms. In this regard, students' attendance management in virtual classes is a major challenge encountered by the teachers. Student attendance is a measure of their engagement in a course, which has a direct relationship with their active learning. However, during virtual learning, it is exceptionally challenging to keep track of the attendance of students. Calling students' names in virtual classrooms to take attendance is both trivial and time-consuming</p>
