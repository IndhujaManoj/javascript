       <p>lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,consecter adipisu elit The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has resulted in an unprecedented crisis across the globe. The pandemic created an enormous demand for innovative technologies to solve crisis-specific problems in different sectors of society. In the case of the education sector and allied learning technologies, significant issues have emerged while substituting face-to-face learning with online virtual learning. Several countries have closed educational institutions temporarily to alleviate the COVID-19 spread. The closure of educational institutions compelled the teachers across the globe to use online meeting platforms extensively. The virtual classrooms created by online meeting platforms are adopted as the only alternative for face â€“ to - face interaction in physical classrooms. In this regard, students' attendance management in virtual classes is a major challenge encountered by the teachers.

    <h2>subscription</h2><p>around the world has changed into virtual mode significantly. Several countries have closed educational institutions temporarily to alleviate the COVID-19 spread. The closure of educational institutions compelled the teachers across the globe to use online meeting platforms extensively. The virtual classrooms created by online meeting platforms are adopted as the only alternative for face-to-face interaction in physical classrooms. Subsequently, online meeting platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Cisco Webex Meetings are used to create virtual classrooms. Educational institutions, teachers, and students are finding more advantages in using virtual learning that were not previously popular. On the other hand, researchers have identified several challenges associated with the widespread use of virtual learning, which is characterized by quite a lot of interrelated features pertaining to students, teachers, and the technologies involved. In this regard, students' attendance management in virtual classes is a major challenge encountered by the teachers. Student attendance is a measure of their engagement in a course, which has a direct relationship with their active learning. Attendance in a course is a prerequisite as mandated by various universities for the students to take their final examinations in every course. Further, the inclusion of attendance data on students' grade cards is a strategic decision of many universities across the globe to enhance students' attendance and engagement. However, during virtual learning, it is exceptionally challenging to keep track of the attendance of students. Calling students' names in virtual classrooms to take attendance is both trivial and time-consuming.</p>
