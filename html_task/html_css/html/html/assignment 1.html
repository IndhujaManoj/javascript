An assignment is a task that someone in authority has asked you to do. The word assignment is just the noun form of the common verb assign, which you use when you want to give someone a duty or a job. When you assign something, that something is called an assignment.
In this module we are going to develop virtual meet Api. A virtual meet api is a video conferencing tool where instructors and participants engage with each other and with the learning material. The interface between AIPresent and virtual meeting platforms are facilitated through a web interface that runs on the teachers and studentsâ€™ smart devices in master and slave modes, respectively. The faculty, as well as students, should log in to the online learning platform with their smart devices. The web interface page should remain active during the entire course of the class. Here, the web interface at the teachers' smart device facilitates two things.
1) It provides the teacher with a timely reminder to click the web-screen for capturing all students' faces of the virtual class for initiating the attendance entry.
2) It performs the extraction of face images from the web screen.
